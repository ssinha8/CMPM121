    My scene is placed in a fantasy world. The world is full of nature and hills. The enemies are these fantastical creatures with the main character being the small knight. The visuals are toon-like. The objects I included are rocks, plants and trees to make the world feel real. I was inspired by the sprites I used for the creatures. I was scrolling through the free assets on the Unity Store Page and decided to make a world based around them. 

    Assets:

    ALL ASSETS WERE FOUND ON UNITY'S ASSET STORE OUTSIDE OF TERRAIN WHICH WAS SELF BUILT.
